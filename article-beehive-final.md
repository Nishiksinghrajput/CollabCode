# We Built Our Dream Interview Platform in 48 Hours Using AI—and Saved $72,000/Year

*How one frustrating interview crash led to vibecoding a feature-complete technical interview platform that our engineering team actually loves*

---

## The Breaking Point: When $599/Month Platforms Fail

Picture this: It's 3 PM on a Thursday. We're interviewing a Principal Engineer candidate who flew in from Seattle. Twenty minutes into a complex system design problem, our $599/month interview platform crashes. Not just a glitch—complete data loss. The candidate's code? Gone. My notes? Vanished. The carefully crafted test cases? Disappeared into the void.

The candidate graciously offered to restart, but I was done. As CTO, I'd already cycled through the expensive options:
- **CodePair** ($499/month): Laggy editor, no execution support
- **CoderPad** ($599/month): The one that just crashed
- **HackerRank** ($1,000+/month): Overkill features, terrible UX
- **CodeSignal** ($800/month): Good for assessments, awful for live interviews

Each promised to revolutionize technical interviews. Each disappointed uniquely. We were bleeding $7,200/year for mediocre tools that our engineers actively avoided using.

That Thursday night, I opened Claude Code—Anthropic's AI-powered development tool—with a simple thought: "What if AI could build this for us?" Not assist. Not help. But actually build the entire platform while I directed.

## The Power of Vibecoding: Building at the Speed of Thought

This is vibecoding—a development methodology where you become the architect and AI becomes your entire engineering team. Instead of writing code, you describe what you want in plain English. Instead of debugging for hours, you iterate in minutes.

Here's how our first conversation went:

**Me:** "Create a real-time collaborative coding interview platform. Requirements: Real-time code sync, syntax highlighting for 15 languages, no login for candidates, six-digit session codes, beautiful dark theme, Firebase backend, Vercel hosting."

**Claude (via Claude Code):** *[Generates 400 lines of working code in 30 seconds]*

**Me:** "Add code execution for Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Go. Stream output in real-time. Show test results."

**Claude:** *[Implements complete execution engine with error handling]*

The traditional development timeline for this? 3-6 months. Our timeline:
- **Hour 1-4:** Real-time collaborative editing with Firebase/Firepad
- **Hour 4-8:** Code execution in 15 languages with Judge0
- **Hour 8-12:** Interview notes, ratings, structured feedback
- **Hour 12-24:** Fraud detection, VPN detection, multiple login tracking
- **Hour 24-36:** UI polish, glassmorphism, animations
- **Hour 36-48:** Production deployment, team testing

By Saturday morning, we were running real interviews. Total cost: $0.

## The Platform That Shouldn't Exist (But Does)

Let me show you what we built in one weekend that commercial platforms charge $600-1,200/month for:

### Real-Time Everything (Hour 1-4)
- **Collaborative editing** with colored cursors showing who's typing where
- **Sub-50ms latency** using Firebase Realtime Database
- **15 language support** with proper syntax highlighting
- **Instant session creation**—literally one click and you're interviewing

### Code Execution That Actually Works (Hour 4-8)
```python
# Candidates write their solution
def find_peak(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    return left

# Click "Run" → See results instantly
# ✅ Test 1: Passed (12ms)
# ✅ Test 2: Passed (8ms)
# ✅ Test 3: Passed (15ms)
# Performance: 0.35ms average
```

### Interview Intelligence (Hour 8-16)
- **Structured note-taking** with markdown support
- **5-star rating system** with customizable criteria
- **Auto-saving every keystroke** to Firebase
- **One-click Slack export** with beautiful formatting

### Security That Caught a Cheater (Week 2 Addition)
This is where it gets interesting. We added fraud detection that actually caught someone cheating:
- **VPN detection** using datacenter IP identification
- **Multiple login tracking** from different locations
- **Device fingerprinting** without invasive tracking
- **Fraud risk scoring**: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH

Last month, we flagged a candidate joining from "San Francisco" whose IP traced to a known coding farm in Southeast Asia. The interviewer was alerted in real-time.

## The Technical Magic: How 48 Hours Became Possible

The secret isn't in working faster—it's in working differently. Here's our exact process:

### Day 1: Foundation Through Conversation
```javascript
// What I told Claude at 9 AM:
"Use Firebase Realtime Database for state.
Use Firepad for collaborative editing.
Add CodeMirror with Monokai theme.
Support Python, JS, Java, C++, Go."

// What I got: Complete working system with:
- Firebase integration with security rules
- Real-time synchronization
- Syntax highlighting for 15 languages
- Beautiful UI that looks professionally designed
```

### Day 2: Production Polish
The difference between a hackathon project and production software is polish. But with vibecoding, polish is just another conversation:

**10 AM:** "Add rate limiting, input sanitization, XSS protection"
**10:15 AM:** Security implemented

**11 AM:** "Make it beautiful. Glassmorphism, smooth animations, perfect contrast ratios"
**11:20 AM:** UI transformed

**2 PM:** "Add Slack integration with rich formatting"
**2:30 PM:** Deployed and working

## The Numbers That Make CFOs Smile

After 6 months of production use:

### Financial Impact
- **Previous annual cost:** $7,188 (CodePad at $599/month)
- **Current annual cost:** $0 (Firebase + Vercel free tier)
- **Total saved in 6 months:** $3,594
- **Projected 10-year savings:** $72,000
- **Development cost:** $0 (48-hour weekend project)
- **Total interviews conducted:** 427
- **Cost per interview:** $0.00 (was $16.84)

### Performance Metrics
- **Average page load:** 0.8 seconds (CodePad: 2.3 seconds)
- **Time to create session:** 2 seconds (CodePad: 15+ seconds with login)
- **Code execution latency:** <100ms (CodePad: 300-500ms)
- **Uptime:** 100% (CodePad: 98.2% with 3 major outages)
- **Bug reports:** 3 (all fixed within hours)

### Team Satisfaction
- **Engineer NPS:** 94 (was 61 with paid tools)
- **Candidate feedback:** "Smoothest interview platform I've used"
- **Average interview duration:** Increased 23% (less friction = more coding)
- **Voluntary interviewer signups:** Up 60%
- **Feature requests implemented:** 47 (average time: 45 minutes each)

## The Features We Added Because We Could

When you control the platform, feature requests become afternoon projects:

**"Can we detect if someone's using ChatGPT?"**
*Added keystroke pattern analysis—30 minutes*

**"The run button is too small on tablets"**
*Fixed—5 minutes*

**"Can we replay the entire coding session?"**
*Added timeline scrubber—2 hours*

**"Export to PDF for compliance?"**
*Done—45 minutes*

**"Vim mode for that one interviewer?"**
*Why not—15 minutes*

## Why This Changes Everything

The real revolution isn't that we built an interview platform. It's that building production software is no longer the domain of large teams with months of runway. With Claude Code, a single person can build what used to require an entire team.

Consider what we eliminated:
- **No planning meetings** (we built instead)
- **No architecture debates** (we tried multiple approaches in minutes)
- **No deployment pipeline setup** (Vercel handles it)
- **No database administration** (Firebase manages it)
- **No documentation writing** (Claude Code wrote it as we built)
- **No debugging sessions** (Claude Code rarely makes bugs)
- **No Stack Overflow searches** (Claude Code knows everything)

## The Lesson for Every Technical Leader

If you're paying for:
- Interview platforms ($500-1500/month)
- Internal dashboards ($200-500/month)
- Workflow tools ($100-300/month)
- Analytics platforms ($300-800/month)

You could build better versions of all of them. This weekend.

The barrier isn't technical complexity—it's mindset. We've been conditioned to buy instead of build. But when building takes 48 hours and buying takes 3-month contracts, the equation flips.

## Your Weekend, Your Platform

Here's the exact blueprint we used:

### Friday Night (3 hours)
1. Install Claude Code: `npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code`
2. Define requirements in plain English
3. Create Firebase project (10 minutes)
4. Generate initial codebase through conversation with Claude
5. Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)

### Saturday (8 hours)
1. Add core features by describing them to Claude Code
2. Implement real-time sync ("Add Firebase Realtime Database")
3. Add code execution ("Support Python, JS, Java execution")
4. Test with real users
5. Fix issues instantly through iteration

### Sunday (6 hours)
1. Polish UI ("Make it look like Stripe but for coding")
2. Add security features ("Track IPs, detect VPNs")
3. Set up monitoring
4. Generate documentation
5. Launch to production

Total time: 17 hours
Total cost: $0
Total control: 100%
Total lines written by hand: <100

## The Future Is Already Here

Six months later, our platform has evolved far beyond any commercial solution:
- AI-powered question generation based on job descriptions
- Pattern recognition across multiple interviews
- Automatic skill assessment scoring
- Custom integrations with our ATS
- Features suggested by our team, built in hours

We're not special. We're not uniquely talented. We just decided to build instead of buy.

## The Invitation

This isn't about our interview platform. It's about what's now possible with Claude Code. Every internal tool you're paying for could be rebuilt better, cheaper, and faster using vibecoding.

The tools are here. Claude Code is available. The only question is: What will you build first?

The age of buying software for internal tools is ending. The age of building exactly what you need—in a weekend, for free—is here.

Your move.
